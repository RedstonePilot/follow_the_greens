read in smr data
display on window (pygame maybe)
draw taxi(able) lines
ability to add plane (will be filled in by euroscope data hopefully)
select end point and "active" green lines
somehow send that data to the sim...
update/cover all other lights other than on the path
activate/deactiveate stop bars
reset button (turn all lights on/off)
remove python and just let euroscope talk to the sim??????
